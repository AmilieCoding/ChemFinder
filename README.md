This is a JAVA 21 project, if you are using it you MUST have Java 21 installed, if you are manually using the code from main.java you MUST be using JAVA21. Java23 may work but it is untested.<br>

## Using main.class from source
- Open IntelliJ and create a new MAVEN PROJECT.<br>
- Copy the code from main.java into your main.java of your project.<br>
- In your pom.xml add the following<br>
```    
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
