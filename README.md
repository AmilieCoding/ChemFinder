# PubChem ChemFinder
WARNING. THIS IS THE BETA BRANCH. THIS MAY BE UNSTABLE. PLEASE RETURN TO THE MAIN BRANCH IF YOU WISH TO USE THIS SOFTWARE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN TESTING.<br>
<br>
This tool identifies against the PubChem Database in order to check for properties of chemicals.<br>
<br>
This is a JAVA 8 project, if you are using it you MUST have JAVA 8 or later installed, if you are manually using the code from main.java you MUST be using JAVA 8 or later. JAVA 23 should work but it is untested.<br>

## Using main.class from source
- Open IntelliJ and create a new MAVEN PROJECT.<br>
- Copy the code from main.java into your main.java of your project.<br>
- In your pom.xml add the following<br>
```    
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
            <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
            <version>2.11.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```
